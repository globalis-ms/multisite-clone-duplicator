Clones an existing site into a new one in a multisite installation : copies all posts, settings and files

## Description

MultiSite Clone Duplicator adds a "Duplicate Site" functionality to your network installation.  

It allows you to clone any site of your network into a new one : all data, files, users and roles can be copied.  

It is useful when you want to create multiple sites from the same template : Don't waste your time copying the same configuration again and again !  
  
Simple and user-friendly, this plugin extends WordPress core network's functionalities without polluting the dashboard.  

**WARNING :** If you clone the primary site, you must use ```mucd_default_primary_tables_to_copy``` filter to declare plugins and custom database tables, or your cloned site won't be complete

### Features:
* Clones any site of your wordpress multisite installation
* Copies all posts and settings
* Generates log files (if option is checked)
* Copy all files from duplicated site (if option is checked)
* Keep users and roles from duplicated site (if option is checked)
* Configure which site is clonable (so you can define an unique "pattern" site)
* Fully hookable
* Command line ready (provides a WP-CLI subcommand)

## Installation

You can install MultiSite Clone Duplicator using the built in WordPress plugin installer. It’s easy, 2 seconds.

If you prefer download MultiSite Clone Duplicator manually :

1. Upload ``` multisite-clone-duplicator/ ``` to the ``` /wp-content/plugins/ ``` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. (Optional) ``` Chmod 777 ``` the logs/ directory of the plugin, if you want to activate logs
4. Go to My Sites > Network Admin > Duplication and enjoy !
5. (Optional) Change default options into Network dashboard > Network settings > Duplication

In the future, you'll probably want to create a dedicated "template" blog to clone from.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it work ?
* It creates a new user if the email was not an existing email
* It creates a new blog with appropriate title and admin user
* It copies all tables from cloned site, but keep some options (like title, domain, etc) of the new blog
* It searches and replaces old site's URL and DOMAINS with the new ones
* It copies upload directory from the old site to the upload directory of the new one (if option is checked)
* It imports users and roles from the old site to the new one (if option is checked)

### Does it support subdirectory AND subdomain installations ? 
Yes, it supports both !

### Can I clone the primary site ? 
Yes you can, but you want to be careful : WordPress saves network tables and primary blog tables with the same prefix, and some of their data are mixed. It forces us to restrict primary blog cloning to copy only the default wp tables. If you want to change this (for example, include your plugin tables in the cloning), use mucd_default_primary_tables_to_copy filter. In the future, you want probably not to copy again and again the primary blog : use a "template" blog dedicated to clonage instead.

### Does it clone plugins settings ? 
Yes it does !

### But some data are serialized ?
It's not a problem ! Serialized data are understood by the plugin, recursively unserialized, replaced with appropriate values, and serialized again.

### After cloning, new site was created, but it goes on 404 page, why ?
Check your host / server configuration : you probably cloned your site into a domain that is not available !

### How to duplicate with command line commands ?
Install [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), go to your wordpress multisite directory, and type 
``` 
wp-cli site duplicate --source=<id_of_the_site_to_clone> --slug="<slug_of_the_new_site>"
```

Arguments are : 
``` 
wp site duplicate --slug=<slug> --source=<site_id> [--title=<title>]
  [--email=<email>] [--network_id=<network-id>] [--private] [--porcelain] [--v]
  [--do_not_copy_files] [--keep_users] [--log=<dir_path>]
```

### Which languages are currently supported? 
As of now, following languages are supported : English (en_US), French (fr_FR), Spanish (es_ES), Lithuanian (lt_LT) and Greek (el). If you wish to, you can translate the interface in your own language in the [standard WordPress way](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) or with [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/multisite-clone-duplicator/)
